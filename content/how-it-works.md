## The idea

Summarum is a **manual, privacy-first tracker for numbers over time**.

It does **not** connect to banks.
It does **not** download transactions.
It does **not** run in the background.

Instead, you stay in control.

---

## Step 1: Create a series

A **series** is simply something you want to track over time.

Examples:

- Checking account balance
- Stock portfolio value
- Crypto wallet total
- Car or motorbike mileage
- Body weight

You can create as many series as you want.

---

## Step 2: Add values (two ways)

### Option A: Manual entry
Type a value and a date. Done.

### Option B: Screenshot or photo
This is where Summarum shines.

1. Open the app that shows your number (banking app, broker, scale, odometer).
2. Take a screenshot or photo.
3. Share it to Summarum.

Summarum analyzes the image **on your device**:

- extracts the number
- detects the date
- suggests the right series

You can always adjust before saving.

---

## Step 3: See trends, not noise

Summarum turns your values into simple graphs:

- one series at a time
- or multiple series together

This lets you see:

- long-term trends
- progress over months or years
- how different values evolve side by side

No spreadsheets. No logins.

## What Summarum is (and isn't)

<div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
<div style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><span style="color: #10b981;">✔</span> A personal time-series tracker</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><span style="color: #10b981;">✔</span> Fully manual, fully private</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><span style="color: #10b981;">✔</span> Works with any bank, in any country</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><span style="color: #10b981;">✔</span> Supports any currency or unit</div>
</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
<div style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><span style="color: #ef4444;">✖</span> Not a budgeting app</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><span style="color: #ef4444;">✖</span> No automatic syncing</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><span style="color: #ef4444;">✖</span> No transaction lists</div>
</div>

If you're looking for automation, Summarum is probably not for you.
If you want **clarity and control**, it probably is.
