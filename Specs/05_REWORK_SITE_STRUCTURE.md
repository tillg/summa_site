# Rework site structure

A site designer / expert gave me this guidance:

---

Perfect, this helps a lot. I’ll do three things below:
	1.	Propose a clean page structure (minimal, aligned with your goals)
	2.	Explain what content lives where and why
	3.	Provide a concrete draft for each page, ready to paste into markdown files

I’ll base this strictly on your current structure and philosophy, keeping the site small and non-salesy. I’m referencing your current index.md structure as the baseline  ￼.

⸻

1. Recommended Page Structure (Minimal but Clear)

You only really need 4 pages:
	1.	Landing page (index.md)
→ Answer “What is this?” in 10–20 seconds
→ Get people to TestFlight
	2.	How it works (how-it-works.md)
→ Answer “How does this actually work?”
→ Kill misunderstandings (banks, automation, compatibility)
	3.	FAQ (faq.md)
→ Answer “Is this for me?” and “What it is NOT”
→ Defuse wrong expectations early
	4.	Privacy (privacy.md)
→ Start with your No Bullshit Privacy Statement
→ Then legal text (already done 👍)

That’s it.
No blog, no comparison tables on the landing page, no clutter.

⸻

2. What Goes Where (High-level)

Landing page (index.md)

Goal: clarity + confidence, not completeness

Keep:
	•	Hero
	•	CTA
	•	Feature tiles
	•	Screenshots

Add:
	•	A very short “How it works (in 3 steps)” teaser
	•	Links to How it works and FAQ

❌ Do NOT put long explanations here
❌ Do NOT explain banks, currencies, edge cases here

⸻

How it works (how-it-works.md)

Goal: explain the mental model once and for all

This page should make it impossible to ask:

“Which banks does it support?”
“Is it automatic?”
“Does it download my data?”

This is where your screenshot-based workflow shines.

⸻

FAQ (faq.md)

Goal: expectation management

This page filters users:
	•	People who want Mint/Credit Karma automation → politely redirected
	•	Privacy-focused, manual-control users → reassured

⸻

Privacy (privacy.md)

Already good.
Your “No Bullshit” section is perfect at the top.

⸻

3. Drafts Per Page (Ready to Paste)

⸻

🏠 index.md (Landing Page Draft)

You already have most of this. I’ll only show what to add, below your screenshots.

## How it works (in short)

1. **Check a number**  
   Open your banking app, investment app, scale, or car dashboard.

2. **Screenshot or take a photo**  
   Share it to Summarum.

3. **See it as a graph**  
   Summarum extracts the value and adds it to the right series — all on your device.

No accounts. No bank connections. No cloud required.

[Read the FAQ →](/faq)

That’s it.
Short, skimmable, confidence-building.

This is the most important explanatory page.

## The idea

Summarum is a **manual, privacy-first tracker for numbers over time**.

It does **not** connect to banks.
It does **not** download transactions.
It does **not** run in the background.

Instead, you stay in control.

---

## Step 1: Create a series

A *series* is simply something you want to track over time.

Examples:
- Checking account balance
- Stock portfolio value
- Crypto wallet total
- Car or motorbike mileage
- Body weight

You can create as many series as you want.

---

## Step 2: Add values (two ways)

### Option A: Manual entry
Type a value and a date. Done.

### Option B: Screenshot or photo
This is where Summarum shines.

1. Open the app that shows your number (banking app, broker, scale, odometer).
2. Take a screenshot or photo.
3. Share it to Summarum.

Summarum analyzes the image **on your device**:
- extracts the number
- detects the date
- suggests the right series

You can always adjust before saving.

---

## Step 3: See trends, not noise

Summarum turns your values into simple graphs:
- one series at a time
- or multiple series together

This lets you see:
- long-term trends
- progress over months or years
- how different values evolve side by side

No spreadsheets. No logins.

---

## What Summarum is (and isn’t)

✔ A personal time-series tracker  
✔ Fully manual, fully private  
✔ Works with any bank, in any country  
✔ Supports any currency or unit  

✖ Not a budgeting app  
✖ No automatic syncing  
✖ No transaction lists  

If you’re looking for automation, Summarum is probably not for you.
If you want **clarity and control**, it probably is.

❓ faq.md

This is where you directly answer the misunderstandings you already saw.

---
title: FAQ
template: page
---

## Which banks does Summarum support?

All of them — and none of them.

Summarum does not connect to banks at all.
If you can **see a number on your screen**, Summarum can track it.

This works for:
- banks in DE, FR, BE, US
- Wise and multi-currency accounts
- brokers, crypto apps, anything else

---

## Are values updated automatically?

No — and that’s intentional.

You update values:
- manually
- or by sharing a screenshot or photo

This avoids:
- broken bank connections
- expired permissions
- third-party access to your data

---

## Does Summarum download my data?

No.

Summarum never:
- downloads transactions
- fetches balances
- talks to bank APIs

Everything starts with **you**.

---

## Can I track multiple currencies?

Yes.

Each series is independent.
You can track EUR, USD, CHF, BTC — anything.

Summarum does not convert currencies (yet).
It shows trends, not accounting reports.

---

## Is my data private?

Yes. Completely.

- All analysis happens on your device
- No analytics
- No tracking
- No accounts

If you enable iCloud sync, your data is stored in **your own iCloud**, not on our servers.

(See the privacy page for the no-bullshit version.)


⸻

🔐 privacy.md

You already did this well.
Structure should be:

## No Bullshit Privacy Statement
...plain language...

---

## Legal Privacy Policy
...formal text...

Nothing else needed.

Final Recommendation (Important)

Your current instinct is right:
	•	Keep the landing page short
	•	Move explanations off the homepage
	•	Use plain language everywhere

This structure will:
	•	reduce wrong expectations
	•	attract the right users
	•	save you from answering the same questions again and again

If you want, next we can:
	•	tighten the hero copy even more
	•	rewrite feature titles for App Store screenshots
	•	design onboarding text that matches the site tone
