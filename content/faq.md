---

## Which banks does Summarum support?

All of them — and none of them.

Summarum does not connect to banks at all.
If you can **see a number on your screen**, Summarum can track it.

This works for:

- banks in DE, FR, BE, US
- Wise and multi-currency accounts
- brokers, crypto apps, anything else

---

## Are values updated automatically?

No — and that's intentional.

You update values:

- manually
- or by sharing a screenshot or photo

This avoids:

- broken bank connections
- expired permissions
- third-party access to your data

---

## Does Summarum download my data?

No.

Summarum never:

- downloads transactions
- fetches balances
- talks to bank APIs

Everything starts with **you**.

---

## Can I track multiple currencies?

Yes.

Each series is independent.
You can track EUR, USD, CHF, BTC — anything.

Summarum does not convert currencies (yet).
It shows trends, not accounting reports.

---

## Is my data private?

Yes. Completely.

- All analysis happens on your device
- No analytics
- No tracking
- No accounts

If you enable iCloud sync, your data is stored in **your own iCloud**, not on our servers.

(See the [privacy page](privacy.html) for the no-bullshit version.)
